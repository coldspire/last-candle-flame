title: Mapping Out with RxJS
description: How I finally came to understand the RxJS flattening operators.

---
### The journey

The Pluralsight course "Play by Play: Angular and ngrx," \[VERIFY AND GET LINK\] Duncan Hunter mentions that the learning curve of [RxJS](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/ "RxJS home page") can be visualized through a repeated pattern of small flat periods of understanding followed by sheer ascents of struggle. This post is about my latest journey through one of those ascents: struggling to understand the flattening operators of RxJS.

#### The accused

\[Brief mention of the operators in question\]

### All over the place

\[mention previous attempts to understand. Link to the documentation, that one blog post that compares the operators to office work, Stack Overflow questions and answers, etc\]

### The breakthrough

\[Mention the Angular Show episode that talks about the operators and how the realization came to be\]

#### Demo

\[Create and link to CodePen demo\]

#### Conclusion

\[talk about passing through the latest ascent, catching my breath on the flatland, and looking towards and up and up at the next ascent\]
